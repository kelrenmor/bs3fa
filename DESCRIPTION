Description: Bayesian sampler for sparse and smooth supervised factor analysis, appropriate for data in which you observe functional Y and numeric (continuous, binary, count) data X. The model assumes all variation in Y is explained by some low-dimensional factors eta, and these factors also explain part (but not all) of the variation in X.
